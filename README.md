#TETRIS PUZZLE #


A file README.txt listing the programs and how to use them in practice. This file must contain all
the instructions necessary for execution; It is very important to explain to the user how to use the tool.

## How to play: THE RULES
In this game, you have a set of blocks that you have to place in turns on a board (the board has 3 shapes possible and blocks vary from one board shape to another). 
To do place a block, simply enter the coordinates of the spot you want to put the block on. Keep in mind that the block you are placing is centered by its bottom left square ! 
The idea is to place each block in the location that eliminates as many rows and/or columns as possible. These are automatically deleted when they are full. For every deleted square, your score goes up by 1 point. Good luck !!

## Requirements
This project was written exclusively in python. 
Make sure you have at least python 3.10 installed to start playing (although having the latest version is even better !)


## Configuration 
In the folder, you will find 3 files/ main.py, Grid.py and Blocks.py . Grid.py and Blocks.py are two files containing the functions needed to execute main.py . 
So to start playing the game, just go to the main.py file and execute it. The game will then appear in the python console/terminal. From there, no need to do anything else, simply follow what the display tells you to on the screen.
