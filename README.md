# Tetris Puzzle

## How to play : THE RULES OF THE GAME
In this game, you have a set of blocks that you have to place in turns on a board (the board has 3 shapes possible and blocks vary from one board shape to another). 
To place a block, simply enter the coordinates of the spot you want to put the block on. Keep in mind that the block you are placing is centered by its bottom left square ! 
The idea is to place each block in the location that eliminates as many rows and/or columns as possible. These are automatically deleted when they are full. For every deleted square, your score goes up by 1 point. Good luck !

## Requirements
This project was written exclusively in python:
Make sure you have at least python 3.10 installed to start playing (having the latest version is better, and running the program with Pycharm IDE is even better !)

## Configuration 
In the folder, you will find 3 files: - main.py
                                      - Grid.py 
                                      - Blocks.py 

The two files Grid.py (13 functions) & Blocks.py (5 functions) contain all that is needed to execute main.py . So to play, you must download THE WHOLE folder.

## Execute : START PLAYING
To start playing the game, just go to the main.py file and execute it. The game will then appear in the python console/terminal. From there, no need to do anything else, simply follow what the display tells you to on the screen.
To every wrong input you give, the program will have an adapted response and WILL NOT CRASH. Therefore, read properly the instructions given on the screen and everything will be fine.

## First go
If this is your first time playing, note that you will have a choice at the beginning: 
                      - to resume a previously saved game
                                       or
                              - start a new game
For the first option, you will have to enter the name of the txt file you want to reload. So if it's your first time, chose the second option!

## Last piece of advice
You must not forget a VERY IMPORTANT ELEMENT. Necessary to reach the goal of this game; imperative to exploit it to its maximum; obligatory to really fullfil the purpose of its entertainment; and definitely mandatory to attain the grail of the game: 
                                                              -->  DO NOT FORGET TO HAVE FUN !!!
